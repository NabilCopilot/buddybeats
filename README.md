## Tests

Test are locate in the file tests\Feature for the integration test or tests\Unit for unit test. In this case I'm using both of them. To run them use: 
  ```
    php artisan test
  ```
If only wanna run unit tests use this command:
  ```
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit
  ```
Or this command for integration tests:
  ```
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature
  ```

Those packages are also needed to run the test:
  ```
    composer require --dev orchestra/testbench
    composer require --dev nyholm/psr7
    composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
  ```

## Deploy

I used this website called HEROKU, where you can host your website and database for free with some restriccions. But for this purpose it's enough. The website performance its not the greatnest but it does the job.
